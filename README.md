### __FFRPG (Returner's Final Fantasy Role Playing Game)__

*This repository acts as an unofficial mirror and an unofficial source for some related materials for the Returner's Final Fantasy Role Playing Game.*

*I created this repository primarily to host the core rulebook and my character sheet template, so, unless I receive pull requests containing new material, updates and new commits are likely to be rare.*

*If you wish to contribute/add content/material to this repository, feel free to fork it and submit pull requests. However, "Final Fantasy" is owned, licensed and copyrighted by Square Enix, and so, any content/material protected/covered by their copyright and/or any similar copyrights, and any content/material not covered by Creative Commons, will be refused, as to ensure that this repository remains compliant with all relevant copyright laws.*

#### Contents of this repository as of the latest commit:###
- "Rulebook": Core rulebook for FFRPG, originally crafted by Returner Games Inc (their original website doesn't exist anymore, but a website exists, [FFRPG.NET](http://www.ffrpg.net/), approximating the role fulfilled by their original website). The version of the core rulebook included in this repository is version "3.0", and is offered in PDF format.
- "Character Sheet": Because the core rulebook doesn't contain a character sheet template for creating your characters, I created a template myself. My character sheet template is offered in both ODS (OpenDocument Spreadsheet) and PDF formats.
